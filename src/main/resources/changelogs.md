## Version Release v1.0.0 Fabric-1.20.1

### Additions
- Released the mod

### Note
- This mod is a project that had been in development for months, most of which it was stuck at a "99% done" standing.
This was back when I was a Fabric only developer, I plan to rewrite the mod's code for MultiLoader and also just to better the code itself like the rest of my 
projects then after which new content updates may release. I decided since it is in a playable state I may aswell release this version of the mod, so enjoy :)
